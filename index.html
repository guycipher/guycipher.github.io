                HELLO WORLD!!
            </h2>
            <div class="story">
                <p>I'm Alex, and I've been obsessed with computers since I got my first one at 7 years old. While other kids were playing video games, I was taking apart my computer to see how it worked (much to my parents' horror). That curiosity led me down a rabbit hole that I'm still exploring 20+ years later.</p>

                <p>At 13, I discovered programming and fell in love with the idea that <span class="highlight">you could make computers do literally anything</span>. Started with game development, moving into web stuff, and by 16 I was running my own freelance business building websites for anyone who'd pay me.</p>

                <p>But life's funny - I took some detours. Worked as a carpenter, a train conductor, wrote real-time political messaging systems, blogging systems, and more! Now I'm in customer success and operations at a payments company. Each path taught me something different.</p>

                <p>These days, I spend my nights and weekends building storage systems. Why? Because they're at the heart of everything, and I love the challenge of making data storage fast, reliable, and elegant. </p>

                <p>Besides writing systems and solving problems I enjoy learning about history, swimming, big dogs, riding motorcycles, going to the gym, gardening, and socializing with other humans!</p>

                <p>I read a fair bit but not as much as I probably would like.</p>

                        Got my first computer and immediately started taking it apart. Parents thought I'd broken it, but I was just figuring out how everything connected.

                        I'd get electronics as well and take them apart.  It's interesting I remember making my own amplifier for a set of speakers I found with a car battery ( yes, I was that kid ).

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        I discovered programming through an interest in online games.  At the time I was playing RuneScape and MapleStory (rather obsessed as always) I wanted to understand how the games worked, how the network allowed for all these simultaneous connections from all over the world.  This led me into game development and network programming. Spent countless hours learning C, C++, Java and nose deep in forums, books and more. I was hooked.

                        Started my own freelance development business, building everything from property management systems to law firm websites using Rails, React, Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more. No challenge was too big - I built everything from the ground up, learning new technologies as I went.  I was working part-time jobs as well, crazy time.

Learned about building physical systems, leadership, safety, awareness, more engineering, and to work under pressure at any time of day. Never stopped programming though (literally obsessed).  I remember writing my own VST at one point and even have a track from the experience you can find here: <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/chvFzhwtDVmeECpypL" target="_blank">SoundCloud (Mesmic - Natural (2010))</a>.

                        Full relational database because why not? Supports SQL-86, stored procedures, replication. Turns out building a query parser and executor is actually pretty fun and seriously damn hard.  I am rewriting the system to follow a more System-R approach on the side, it's taking a while but I am enjoying the process.  Long-term I'd like to implement modern SQL.

Wrote this when I got curious about how to make databases scale horizontally without losing your mind.  CursusDB was one of my first attempts at writing a database, from completely knowing nothing about internals, lexical analysis, parsing, executing and more.  It was a great learning experience and I would love to revisit sometime in the future.
